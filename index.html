            <h1>Hey, thanks for stopping by!</h1>
            <p>
                I am <strong>Callan Chesser</strong>, a student technician. I am currently in secondary school and work on projects in and out of school.
                I love helping out in lighting, sound, backstage, and everything theatre because it brings so much enjoyment to me. 
                I started helping out in 2023, and since then I have continued to work on projects! One of the places I help is 
                <strong>Summer In The City</strong> — a summer camp that also offers a theatrical camp. If you’re interested, get in touch or check out some of my credits!

                “Callan performed all many technical and organizational duties relating to our theatre and drama camp from lighting to sound engineering as well helping with performance
                run throughs. Callan approached his duties with a level of maturity that is rare to find in a young adult. He mixed very well with his colleagues as well as our campers.
                All staff noted his value and his tenacity. I would characterize Callan as observant, determined, conscientious and eager to learn.”

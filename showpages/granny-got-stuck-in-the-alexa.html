        <h3>About the Show</h3>
        <p>For this production of Granny Got Stuck In The Alexa, I worked with our director Mr Neil Simpson, supporting a main cast of P7s and additional P1–P7 students involved in the songs. My role was operating the follow spot across three performances and during technical and dress rehearsals, helping bring the show to life for all participants.</p>

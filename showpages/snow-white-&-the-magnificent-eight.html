        <h3>About the Show</h3>
        <p>For my debut amateur production at Drumchapel Panto Club, I was the Technical Director and Sound Mixer. As the technical director it was my job to design, and arrange all logistical things. This show had a lot of cool lighting effects and cues, as well as the use of mics for every character.</p>

        <h3>Extra Notes</h3>
        <p>I had two additional crew to help me (on-book SM, and LX operator). During rehearsals every Sunday I would attend and sort logistics and practice operation. This was a very fun debut performance!</p>

        <h3>About the Show</h3>
        <p>For Granny Got Stuck In The Telly, I assisted backstage during technical and dress rehearsals as well as two performances. The production, written and directed by Mr Neil Simpson, involved a main cast of P7s with contributions from P1–P7 in songs, and I helped ensure smooth transitions and mic changes for the performers.</p>

        <h3>About the Show</h3>
        <p>For my debut Drama Club production, I collaborated with our tech director Mrs. Wishart, to manage the overall technical design including sound & lighting. It was a great show to get to learn about all the formalities of the tech world, like LX plots and plans and cue maps etc. The cast was a S1-S3 lot, and I was guiding the team through connected cues and any other places where assistance was needed as well as rehearsals!</p>

        <strong>Role:</strong> Technical Director/Sound Mixer<br>
        For my debut amateur production at Drumchapel Panto Club, I was the Technical Director and Sound Mixer. As the technical director it was my job to design, and arrange all logistical things. This show had a lot of cool lighting effects and cues, as well as the use of mics for every character. Ontop of my duties, I had two additional crew to help me (on-book SM, and LX operator) who helped for the shows. During rehearsals every Sunday I would attend and sort logistics, operate the show (practising), and more. This was a very fun debut preformance, and one I will not forget!
